    - COMBAT. <updated 9-26-19>
        > Three main types of combat:
            > Swarm:
                > 1hp = 1 enemy.
                > basic combat system.
                > Sneaking works differently
                > I'll flesh this all out later.
            > Individual:
                > Singular enemy.
                > Three moves that you have to guess.
                > "Enemy looks like they'll slash, lung, push"
                > Player must choose between two options + a "safe" option
                    > Example: Strike {right}/{left}, {Parry}/{Feight}, {Hold} Ground/{Riposte}
                    > Safe example: {Dodge}, {Block}, {defend}
                > Guessing wrong causes player to deal reduced/no damage and take damage less/no.
                > Guessing right deals more damage to enemy/less to you.
                > Playing safe on option deals min damage to you & no damage to enemy.
                    > Used to find/memorize enemy attack pattern.
                > Attack patterns change depending on player/random so combat doesn't become stale.
                > Three attack phases: Start/middle/end
                    > Start:
                        > Surprise attack for you/enemy.
                        > PSF: Can use items/sneak attack/free shot/hide
                        > ESF: Enemy gets special dialogue? I dunno. Let's keep it simple for now.
                        > One command, not three.
                    > Mid:
                        > Normal attack structure
                        > As stated above.
                        > additional special abilities to come later.
                        > Limited number of times based on... Lets say 3 for now.
                    > End:
                        > One command, like Start.
                        > After Mid, ending depends on who has taken more damage.
                            > Player: Run away/plead/play dead/last ditch effort
                            > Enemy:
    - COMBAT 2.0 <updated 9-28-19>
        > For melee combat ONLY
            > For the moment...
        > BF Starts with enemy using a sword move "slash, lunge, feight, thrust, beat attack"
        > Each attack has a list of "counter" moves
            > Players encouraged to memorize counters
                > If player doesn't have a counter, they can also block.
        > Play responds with ONE (not three) move.
            > Available moves are backed on class & level.
        > If correct counter is chosen, enemy gets damage.
        > If incorrect counter, player gets damaged.
        > Enemy AI choices from list of moves, selected at random.
            > The more correct counters it has available will auto increase chance of countering player.
        > This continues for three turns. Whoever wins at least two counters, wins.
            > Blocking does not count towards turns.
        > Winning allows you to spare or kill enemy.
        > Loosing gives you option to surrender or "last ditch"
            > Last ditch gives a percent (50% or 25% probably) to kill enemy.
        > Surrendering gives you 1hp of damage.
        > failing a last ditch deals double damage.
        > Maybe lose items or gold? Dunno.



Items (added 9/20/19)
    - Items can be used in battle
        > Items used in battle can give buff or auto-win
        > All items are single use
        > Using wrong items can (but not always) have penalties.
        > Items stored in single cell delineated by comma w/ quanity shown between straight line.
            > example: item|2,item|4,item|1
            > When number in bracket hits zero, item removed.
        > Items uses & description stored as tuple.
        > Limit should be placed on both # of items & quantity, 10 for each ATM.
            > too many items: forces user to drop one.
                > NEVER implement auto pickup ever!!!
            > Prevents user from going over sent quantity of an item if user tries.

Equipment
    -

Encounters
    - fifth part of a dungeon touple.
    - Made up of a letter combo.
        > B = bandits
        > R = rats
        > M = monster
        > L = treasure (loot)
        > T = Traps

Walk State
    - Literally just walking.
    - Single phase.
        > No Phase (NP)
    <UPDATE 9/21/19>
    - Users can find/search for items on the ground!!!

Combat state
    - Combat is currently single turn. This will not stand.
    - New system will be made up of three phases.
        > Start phase (SP)
            > Determines if player or enemy spots other first.
            > PSF = "Player spotted first". Player can go first.
            > ESF = "Enemy spotted first".  Enemy goes first.
            > Player going first gives special options based on class such as talking, hiding, free shot, etc.
            > Player may also choose to return to previous square.
            > Enemy going first auto moves to battle phase.
            > One turn ONLY. Any action taken while in P (including look) moves to battle phase.
            > "Use item" (All classes)
                > Different items have different effects.
                > Holywater hurts undead, food can be used to distract animals etc.
        > Battle phase (BP)
            > Player replies from list of possible actions.
            > Example: melee, class ability, item, etc.
            > BP repeats until one side has victory.
            > Optimal length for BP is three turns/tweets.
        > Alt phase:
            > "Hide" (thief only*):
                > Works like "wlk" state.
                > Allows player to leave any square available (not just previous one).
                > Reentering square starts combat phase all over.
                > Option to sneak attack.
            > "Talk" (Acolyte only*):
                > Pursuade some opponents not to fight.
                > Can also be used to bribe some enemies.
                > Mostly only usable on intelligent enemies.
                    > Undead, read scripture out loud maybe?
                > Maybe sometimes get a special bonus?
            > * = Some encounters allow other classes to access these phases.
                > Nomads can enter "Hide" when outside and/or wild animals.
                > Bandits can enter "Talk" with other bandits (Maybe other types?)
        > End phase (EP)
            > Enemy wins, player is dead or knocked out.
                > knocked out, chance of getting knocked out when health reaches halfway. Lose some items/gold.
                > Dead, health reaches zero. New character.
                > Square now empty
            > Player wins, enemy has left or been slain.
                > Receives gold/items/exp.
                > Square now empty.
                > Potential after effects of items/abilities?
            > either outcome, player can only heal half of damage taken- rounded up.

                > Or maybe use items while in combat?
            > Melee focus (Bonus to Tough)
            > Special abilities: SP
                > Can talk down other bandits.
                > "Free shot" (Bandit only*):
                    > Extra damage.
                    > Bandits can switch weapons freely but other classes take a small penalty to "put weapon away" on
                      their next turn.
            > Special abilities: BP

                    > Back stab (bonus damage based on quick)
                    > Every turn in "hide" increased chance of entering battle phase.
                    > Sneak past encounters
            > Special abilities: BP
                    > Dodge: Less damage taken but chance to do no damage.
            > Special abilities: EP

                > Higher chance of human enemies
            > Special abilities: EP
                > Higher chance of getting Knocked Out over killed?

        > Nomad (Wit type)
            > Special abilities: SP
                > "Ingest Herb":
                    > Take special herbs to give bonuses based on enemy fighting.
                    > No hint will be given to the player on what herb does what.
                    > MUST have herb in items.
                    > Herbs are found in overworld, dungeons or purchased.
                    > Some herbs have negative after effects.
            > Special abilities: BP
                > Based on herb taken:
                    > More damage given but more damage taken.
                    > Bonus to certain enemy type (or penalty if taken wrong herb).
                    > Temp HP loss after battle.
                    > Chance to get auto-knocked out during battle.
                    > Temp HP bonus
                    > Removes ability to get knocked out (double edged sword)
                    > Blacked out, battle auto ends.
            > Special abilities: EP
                > Chance of killing all enemies if Knocked Out b/c they ingested your herbs?

Tracker design
    - Current tracker:
        > Full string: 1^1,2^1B0,2^2M0,3^2T0,4^2T0,4^3L0
        > Singular cell: (position)(type of encounter)(number of things in encounter)
        > Example: 2^1R2 (two rats on cell 2^1)
    - New design concept:
        > cell: (position)+"|"+(type of encounter)+"|"+(phase of encounter()+"|"+(number)
        > example: 2^1|Rat|PSF|2 (two rats on cell 2^1. Player goes first.)
    - SECOND new design concept.
        > Example" 2^1|T|xx|5|5|
    - Encounter needs to function differently for each state but LOOK the same.
    - Combat: (see combat section)
        >
Interact (9/21/19)
    - Three kinds of interactions:
        > Trap (to avoid)
        > Puzzle (to solve)
        > Items (to pickup/find)
    - Traps
        > Find traps automatically.
        > Thieves/quick classes get bonuses to avoid them and/or avoid and/or spot certain types.
        > Single turn encounters.
            > given actions like "jump right/left" but randomized.
            > Small hints in wording/grammar used for perceptive players.
    - Puzzles
        > Look up zork?
        > I'll figure it out later.
    - Items
        > Items are found while in wlk.
